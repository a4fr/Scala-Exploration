# Scala Exploration

In this repository, Scala tutorial based on some books is explored through Jupter Notebook.

### 1. Install Scala kernel on jupyter notebook

To to this, just walk through **Quick Start** section of below github repository:

https://github.com/jupyter-scala/jupyter-scala



### 2. Running Scala source codes

You may run Scala source codes through these options:

1. Scala REPL which let you run simple commands interactively. But you cannot run complex source codes which have dependencies issues. To use it just install below package in the shell:

   ```shell
   $ sudo apt install scala
   ```

2. sbt: is an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source) [build tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_tool) for Scala and Java projects, similar to Java's [Maven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven) and [Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Ant). It compiles and runs your source codes with heavily supporting dependencies. For more information please visit:

   https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started-sbt-track/getting-started-with-scala-and-sbt-on-the-command-line.html

3. IntelliJ IDEA: s a Java integrated development environment (IDE) for developing Java and Scala programs. You can combine sbt power with great IntelliJ IDE features to write your Scala projects. To create and configure a Scala project first install Scala plugin in in the IDE and then use below link for rest of the procedure:

   https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started-intellij-track/building-a-scala-project-with-intellij-and-sbt.html

### 3. ToDo Sections:

* Introduction of Scala: Its features over Java and python

* Basics

* Control Structures

* Collections: This sections is on the most important sections of Scala. you can find recommended tutorial for this chapter on the below link:
